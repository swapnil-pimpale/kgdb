There are three patches present in this directory. 
Work on these patches(lk.patch and context.patch) are still going on. 
for now one can use gdb-kgdb-module-notification.patch. 

1. Applying patches
Base GDB version: 6.4

You can use quilt for quick,efficent and reversible application of patches. 
Quilt uses a series file which has the order in which the patches have to be 
applied. Then quilt push and pop commands can be used for applying and removing 
the patches respectively. Keep only those patchfile names in series file which u
want to apply. Quilt can be downloaded from : 
http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt
If you do not want use quilt, then while applying the patches follow the 
order given in 'series' file.

2. Building gdb
Compile the gdb with a configure followed by a make.

3. Using gdb
Supply vmlinux to gdb on command line and specify osabi to be "Linux-kernel"
_before_ "target remote" command.

Example:

[amitkale@pythagoras gdb-build]$ gdb/gdb  ~/build/2.6.9-rc2-i386/vmlinux
