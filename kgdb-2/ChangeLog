2007-06-13 Jason Wessel <jason.wessel@windriver.com>
	Sergei Shtylyov <sshtylyov@ru.mvista.com>
	* Code cleanup in core-lite.patch remove uneeded variable checks
	in early init.

2007-06-12 Jason Wessel <jason.wessel@windriver.com>
	* Move the early_init calls from breakpoint() to avoid possible
	.init_text section problems
	* Remove the breakpoint tasklet from the early initialization and
	defer breakpoints to the late_init. On SMP x86_64 in particular
	scheduling a tasklet too early can result in a silent death hang
	in the system, as there is a race to setup the exception stack vs
	the schduling context vs kgdb having the ability to debug the
	exception.

2007-06-11 Jason Wessel <jason.wessel@windriver.com>
	* Add a MIPS64 patch to pad the pt_regs such that when an exception
	is taken that the first 48 bytes contain the saved call parameters
	on the stack, and the rest is the normal pt_regs struct.

2007-06-07 Jason Wessel <jason.wessel@windriver.com>
	* Fix on case where the kgdb_may_fault unset was missing
	* Add code to save and restore the preempt count when using the
	kgdb_may_fault context

	* Add hardware breakpoint support for x86_64 and i386 arch
	* Re-organized the HW breakpoint support in the core-lite.patch
	* Removed the i386.patch
	* Added i386-hw_breakpoints.patch and x86_64-hw_breakpoints.patch

2007-05-24 Sergei Shtylyov <sshtylyov@ru.mvista.com> 
	Manish Lachwani <mlachwani@mvista.com>
	* MIPS - smp_call_function() shouldn't be called with interrupts
	disabled, but kgdb_roundup_cpu() fails to actually enable them
	using local_irq_restore() as the 'flags' argument passed to it has
	interrupts already disabled
	* mips handle_exception() does not enable interrupts prior to
	__flush_cache_all() call which also ends up in IPI
	* 'mips_die_head' didn't have its 'lock' field initialized.

2007-05-24 Sergei Shtylyov <sshtylyov@ru.mvista.com> 
	Kevin Hilman <khilman@mvista.com>
	* The serial ports used by kgdb must be initialized very early in
	the boot. The ARM 'init_machine' where serial ports are normally
	initialized is too late since the 'kgdbwait' command-line option
	is handled in the early_param() processing.

2007-05-24 Yuri Shpilevsky <yshpilevsky@ru.mvista.com>
	Sergei Shtylyov <sshtylyov@ru.mvista.com>
	* Add checks for CPM UART being used by KGDB to the console
	setup() and driver probe() methods -- previously it was only in
	the "legacy mode" path of the module_init() function.

2007-05-21 Deepak Saxena <dsaxena@mvista.com>
	Sergei Shtylyov <sshtylyov@ru.mvista.com>
	* Update KGDB serial driver for AMBA PL011 UARTs

2007-05-21 Sergei Shtylyov <sshtylyov@ru.mvista.com>

	* fix the interrupt handler to take no arguments, due to
	2.6.19-rc1 change, remove from it unreacheabe code, and add the
	missing external declaration
	* fix the write_char() method to accept argument of type 'u8'
	* convert the status polling loop in the read_char() method to 'do
	{} while'
	* change 'kgdb_swarm' prefix in the function names to
	'kgdbsibyte', so that they all look alike
	* kill unneeded {pre|post}_exception() method initializers;

2007-05-21 Sergei Shtylyov <sshtylyov@ru.mvista.com> 
	Kevin Hilman <khilman@mvista.com>
	* Fix the register layout of the registers passed to the host gdb,
	so that CPSR is properly interpreted.

2007-05-21 Jason Wessel <jason.wessel@windriver.com>
	* Use the kgdb_arch_handle_exception() to continue in the case of
	a kernel to user space single step.

	step trap if there was a request to step from the kernel to user
	space with a single step instruction.

2007-05-15 Jason Wessel <jason.wessel@windriver.com>
	* Fix some corner cases where KGDB will silently hang or kill the
	system, if a user accidentally tries to source step into a
	spin_unlock() call or source step in on a macro containing
	smp_processor_id().

2007-05-15 Sergei Shtylyov <sshtylyov@ru.mvista.com>
	* Get rid of *all* the remains of the arch/ppc specific KGDB
	implementation.

2007-05-15 Sergei Shtylyov <sshtylyov@ru.mvista.com>
	* Update arch/ppc KGDB implementation
	* merge the begginning of trap-to-signal table containing the more
	or less standard traps for all CPU families
	* make the instruction access trap generate SIGSEGV just like its
	data access counterpart

	6xx/74xx, and 8xx CPU families
	* remove PPC64 data/instruction segment trap codes as they never
	reach the high level code anyway
	* remove table entries for the reserved trap since they should be
	translated to SIGHUP anyway
	* make the code dealing with the SPE registers also compile for
	Freescale E200 CPUs and fix it to correctly skip over if SPE
	support is not enabled
	* fix sleeping_thread_to_gdb_regs() to use the specified (and not
	the current) process' context to retrieve the SPE accumulator and
	SPEFSCR
	* skip over the $r3-$r13 and FP registers do it without duplicate
	zeroing
	* fix coding style (moved/renamed some variables, removed useless
	parens, etc.)

	* Add KGDB support for Bamboo/Luan PPC4xx platforms

2007-05-14 Sergei Shtylyov <sshtylyov@ru.mvista.com>
	* Sanitize the bogus KGDB code for Xilinx ML300

2007-05-14 Sergei Shtylyov <sshtylyov@ru.mvista.com>
	* Replace all #include <asm/kgdb.h> by #include <syslib/gen550.h>
	as the new KGDB header doesn't have the necessary prototypes
	anymore.

2007-05-11 Jason Wessel <jason.wessel@windriver.com>

2007-05-06 Sergei Shtylyov <sshtylyov@ru.mvista.com>
	* Get rid of *all* the remains of the MIPS-specific KGDB
	implementation.  While at it, fix #ifdef's in

	  The program being debugged has been started already.
	  Start it from the beginning? (y or n) y

2004-09-09 Tom Rini <trini@kernel.crashing.org>
	   Deepak Saxena <dsaxena@plexity.net>
	* Have CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_NR_UARTS be set on SERIAL_8250 || KGDB_8250
	  and use this to ensure that RS_TABLE_SIZE exists and is that
	  our rs_table[] will not be empty.  This is required for platforms
	  such as XScale which always dynamically find their serial ports.
	* XScale UARTs have two extra bits that needs to be set in the
	  IER. For this reason we need to copy the type field from the uart
	  struct.
	* Replace SERIAL_IO_MEM with UPIO_MEM as this is the preferred usage.
	* We were calling serial8250_release_irq(gdb_async_info.line) before
	  calling kgdb_local_init, so gdb_async_info.line would be 0.
	  Transposed the two calls.

2004-09-08 Mithlesh Thukral <mithlesh@linsyssoft.com>
	* Changed the x86_64.patch so that it doesn't generate the 
	debugging information for the vsyscall.c, which was causing
	problems in module debugging.

2004-08-17 Tom Rini <trini@kernel.crashing.org>
	* Make kgdb_arch_init on ppc32 an arch_initcall(), as it must
	be initialized if we have KGDB installed.
	* On ppc32, have our function pointers check for !user_mode(regs)
	before moving on.

2004-08-16 Tom Rini <trini@kernel.crashing.org>
	* Clarify in the README what the output will be.
	* Note that we apply to 2.6.8-rc4, 2.6.8 and 2.6.8.1.

2004-08-10 Tom Rini <trini@kernel.crashing.org>
	* Move to 2.6.8-rc4.

	so that we can break into a running system.
	* For PPC32, make some CONFIG_4xx's be more correct as 40x || BOOKE

2004-08-05 Keldon Jones <keldon@hp.com>

	* Move to 2.6.8-rc2.

2004-07-29 Mithlesh Thukral <mithlesh@linsyssoft.com>
	* Modified lite patches not to use the thread_struct member
	debuggerinfo. Instead, defined a data structure where the
	pt_regs pointers from slave cpus would be saved. Moved the
	debuggerinfo member to heavy patches.
	* Added documentation on usage of quilt for applying kgdb patches and
	the changes in console messages because of early_param.

2004-07-16 Tom Rini <trini@kernel.crashing.org>
	* Make use of early_param() so that on i386 at least we can break
	into KGDB early on.

2004-07-14 Tom Rini <trini@kernel.crashing.org>

	* Move all DocBook stuff into the main patches
	* Remove duplicate stuff in core.patch

2004-05-18 Tom Rini <trini@kernel.crashing.org>
	* Move some code that was in '8250' into 'core-lite' where it belongs
	* Kill kgdb_break_early, all we really need here, now, is
	kgdb_schedule_breakpoint().
	* Add missing PPC32 files.

2004-05-17 Tom Rini <trini@kernel.crashing.org>
	* Update to 2.6.6.

2004-04-08 Tom Rini <trini@kernel.crashing.org>
	* As Stelian Pop noted, it's possible for KGDB_CONSOLE && KGDB_ETH
	to do bad things.  So we don't allow for it to happen, hopefully,
	and note can happen both in the help and in the documentation.

2004-04-08 Tom Rini <trini@kernel.crashing.org>
	   Stelian Pop <stelian@popies.net>
	* Make the eth and 8250 interfaces work based on cmdline args,
	and module_init() cause an initial breakpoint. 
	* Fixup the PPC32 driver for this as well.
	* Fix support for the Motorola Sandpoint.

2004-04-05 Stelian Pop <stelian@popies.net>
	* Export either kern_schedule or do_schedule, in the core patch.
	* Cleanup SysRq support.

2004-04-05 Tom Rini <trini@kernel.crashing.org>
	* Move some changes out of core-lite, into core, if we only ask
	about them in the core patch.
	* Update to 2.6.5.

2004-03-30 Tom Rini <trini@kernel.crashing.org>
	* Move i386 HW breakpoint code to i386.patch from i386-lite, it was
	broken.
	* Add an API for flushing all HW breakpoints.
	* Cleanup the handling of z/Z[01] packets, send empty reply
	on all other z/Z packets.
	* Remove kgdb_printexception code, the 'E' packet is reserved.
	* Update DocBook comments based on the textfile from Anurekh Saxena.
	* On PPC32, depend on !SMP, as that code hasn't even been thought
	about yet.

2004-03-24 Tom Rini <trini@kernel.crashing.org>
	* Add DocBook comments to all weak functions to the core patch, and
	merge Documentation/kgdb.txt into the DocBook file.

2004-03-22 Matt Mackall <mpm@selenic.com>
	* Fix a thinko noticed by Andrew Morton in the eth patch.

2004-03-22 Tom Rini <trini@kernel.crashing.org>
	* Shrink the #include list of kgdb_eth.c and cleanup the top
	comments.

2004-03-20 Matt Mackall <mpm@selenic.com>
	* Make sure the kgdboe driver won't be in a half-configured state

2004-03-19 Tom Rini <trini@kernel.crashing.org>
	* Update to 2.6.4.

2004-03-19 Jim Houston <jim.houston@comcast.net>
	* Fixes to x86_64 cfi directives

2004-03-19 Amit S. Kale <amitkale@emsyssoft.com>
	* Fixes to lite patches for getting correct thread listing.
	* Fixed automatic module loading in gdb.

2004-03-12 Amit S. Kale <amitkale@emsyssoft.com>
	* SMP fixes for x86_64

2004-03-08 Tom Rini <trini@kernel.crashing.org>
	* Make PPC32 compile, and split it out into ppc and ppc-lite.

2004-03-04 Amit S. Kale <amitkale@emsyssoft.com>
	* Added some documentation to core-lite
	* Fixed x86_64 kgdb. It didn't handle a debug exception when
	connecting to gdb because kgdb_connected was zero.

2004-03-01 Tom Rini <trini@kernel.crashing.org>
	* On PPC32:
	  - if 0 the changes to save call link in do_IRQ, buggy.
	  - Provide correct hard_trap_info on 44x as well as 40x.
	  - Add in #ifdefs for PPC_SIMPLE_SERIAL, kill kgdbppc_init,
	    by moving work into kgdb_arch_init.
	* Move all configuration options into kernel/Kconfig.kgdb
	* Add SysRq-G support into core.patch.
	* For the serial driver:
	  - We don't need kgdb_might_be_resumed or kgdb_killed_or_detached.
	  - Don't try and look for a connection in put_packet, after we've
	    tried to put a packet.  Instead, when we receive a packet, GDB
	    has connected.  Also make put_packet look at the char it reads,
	    and handle a new packet in the middle (or ^C+packet).
	  - Remove ok_packet().
	  - In kgdb8250_interrupt, only check if this is the right line, and
	    if so, call kgdb_schedule_breakpoint().  This still isn't 100%
	    correct on SMP.
	  - Remove a duplicate extern of kgdb_connected.
	* On x86_64, make KGDB register with die_chain and remove all
	instances of CHK_DEBUGGER.
	* On PPC32, remove all CHK_DEBUGGER statements as we've always
	registered with the arch-specific hooks.
	* For the eth driver:
	  - memset out_buf in case we don't have it full when we flush.
	  - In rx_hook, if netpoll_trap() is set, clear it.  If kgdb_isn't
	    connected, schedule a breakpoint, and never call breakpoint()
	    directly.
	  - In kgdb_serial->hook, call netpoll_set_trap(1).
	    kgdb_serial->hook() must be called prior to using a 'serial'
	    port, so this is where we should stick this.  Call
	    netpoll_set_trap(0) in rx_hook if netpoll_trap().
	  - Backout unneeded changes to other files.

2004-02-25 Tom Rini <trini@kernel.crashing.org>
	* Update the 8250 driver with various things from George Anzinger's
	version.
	* Add, and make use of kgdb_process_breakpoint /
	kgdb_schedule_breakpoint().

2004-02-25 Tom Rini <trini@kernel.crashing.org>
	* Run scripts/Lindent over the new files in core-lite, i386-lite,
	x86_64, 8250, eth patches.
	* Rename arch/ppc/kernel/ppc-stub.c to arch/ppc/kernel/kgdb.c to
	match others, and add back in include/asm-ppc/kgdb.h

2004-02-21  Amit S. Kale <amitkale@emsyssoft.com>
	* Restored calling convention of do_IRQ. Made kgdb walk up a stack,
	find out pt_regs saved before calling do_IRQ and present the stack
	before that it using a shadow thread.
	* Fixed gdb lockup during info threads. Some cleanup had removed a
	code line that terminated ThreadInfo packets.

2004-02-21 Pavel Machek <pavel@suse.cz>
	* Moved non-hacky parts of core.patch and i386.patch into
	core-lite.patch and i386-lite.patch for ease of merging into mainline
	kernel.

2004-02-19 Pavel Machek <pavel@suse.cz>
	* Removed an unecessary modification to generic_hweight64

2004-02-19 Amit S. Kale <amitkale@emsyssoft.com>
	* Moved to kernel 2.6.3

2004-02-18 Tom Rini <trini@kernel.crashing.org>
	* Make CHK_DEBUGGER not warn on !KGDB
	* Don't reply to the sequence-id portion of a packet, this is illegal
	http://sources.redhat.com/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb_33.html#SEC655

2004-02-11 Amit S. Kale <amitkale@emsyssoft.com>
	* Removed pc and sp in exception reporting to gdb

2004-02-10 Amit S. Kale <amitkale@emsyssoft.com>
	* Changed several functions to return negative error number instead of
	-1 to be consistent with the kernel
	* Removed use of a global to detect memory access errors in kgdb by
	preventing kgdb from accessing user addresses
	* Cleanups
	* From someone - Fixed a buffer overflow in getpacket.

2004-02-05 Tom Rini <trini@kernel.crashing.org>
	* Go back to kgdb_serial fn pointer.
	* Fixes to kgdb over ethernet

2004-01-30 Tom Rini <trini@kernel.crashing.org>
	* Change *kgdb_serial into kgdb_serial_driver.  We will now have
	only one serial driver.
	* PPC32: Add KGDB support to the Motorola Sandpoint.

2004-01-30 Pavel Machek <pavel@suse.cz>
	* Convert the kgdb ethernet driver over to netpoll.

2004-01-27 Tom Rini <trini@kernel.crashing.org>
	* Send a 'T' packet initially, not an 'S' followed by 'p'
	* On PPC32, try to pass in the correct signal back.
	* Cleanups
	* Remove the function pointers from kgdb_ops. Most have become
	kgdb_foo, instead of foo. The exceptions are the gdb/kgdb register
	fiddling functions.

2004-01-21 TimeSys Corporation
	* kgdb on powerpc.

2004-01-21 Pavel Machek <pavel@suse.cz>
	* Changes for coding conventions

2004-01-21 Tom Rini <trini@kernel.crashing.org>
	* Added a prototype for kgdb8250_add_port.

2004-01-20 TimeSys Corporation
	* Create a fake function frame at begining of common_interrupt so that
	gdb can trace back from common_interrupt.

2004-01-20 Amit S. Kale <amitkale@emsyssoft.com>
	* Created a ring buffer for kgdb ethernet packets. Several
	fixes and changes to kgdb on ethernet.

2004-01-20 TimeSys Corporation
	* Fixed a problem with not responding to Ctrl+C during priting of
	console messages through gdb.

2004-01-17 Tom Rini <trini@kernel.crashing.org>
	* Some restructuring to allow architectures to provide different
	serial infos to the kgdb serial interface.

2004-01-17 Pavel Machek <pavel@suse.cz>
	* Cleanups
	* changed calling convention from 0 on success, 1 on failure to 0 on
	success, -ERRNO on fail to be more consistent with rest of kernel
	* Made kgdb waiting for connection message KERN_CRIT
	* export kern_schedule only if CONFIG_KGDB_THREAD is defined

2004-01-16 Amit S. Kale <amitkale@emsyssoft.com>
	* Fixed compile errors when CONFIG_KGDB is not configured.
	* Exported kern_schedule.
	* Fixed invalid memory accesses when debuggerinfo is non-zero and
	invalid.
	* Spawn a thread for polling configuration of ethernet interface.

2004-01-12 Pavel Machek <pavel@suse.cz>
	* kgdbeth_opt does not initialize ipaddrptr -> this could not have
	ever worked. [Okay, it still does not work].
	* Add some basic documentation
	* reply_arp can be static, AFAICS
	* getDebugChar() no longer exists, kill it from the docs, read_char()
	should be equivalent.
	* eth_PutDebugChar() seems to be no longer used. Kill it.

2004-01-12 Amit S. Kale <amitkale@emsyssoft.com>
	* Fixed compile warnings about thref and thread when
	CONFIG_KGDB_THREAD is not configured.
