Base Kernel version: 2.6.21.1

Patch:
------
We use quilt (http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt) to manage our
patches.  If you have quilt and a downloaded copy of the base kernel
version in bz2 format,, the easiest way to set things up is:
$ tar jxf linux-<base_kernel_version>.tar.bz2
$ cp -a kgdb-2 linux-<base_kernel_version>/patches
$ cd linux-<base_kernel_version>
$ quilt push -a

To get KGDB applied into a kernel tree.  If you do not want to use quilt, you
must apply all patches in the order they are listed in the series file.
This is most easily done as:
$ tar jxf linux-<base_kernel_version>.tar.bz2
$ cd linux-<base_kernel_version>
$ for p in $(grep patch ../kgdb-2/series);do patch -p1 -si ../kgdb-2/$p;done

Build:
------
Enable following config options (in this order).

Kernel hacking ->
	KGDB: kernel debugging with remote gdb ->
		KGDB: Thread analysis
		KGDB: Console messages through gdb
Device drivers ->
	Character devices ->
		Serial drivers ->
			KGDB: On generic serial port (8250)
	
Boot:
-----
Put 'kgdbwait' on the command line if you have configured KGDB to use the
serial port you want, and you want KGDB to stop on boot.  If you want to
change the options for the serial line and are using the kgdb8250 driver,
pass kgdb8250=0,115200 for example to use ttyS0 at 115200 baud.
Example: For serial line ttyS0 and baud of 115200 command line parameters 
would be :  kgdb8250=0,115200 kgdbwait
Example: To have KGDB stop and wait for a connection on boot : kgdbwait

Since the update for Linux 2.6.8-rc1, which makes use of 'early_param',
you will see the following message similar to the following (example
taken from i386) if you pass 'kgdbwait' on the command line:
	"Uncompressing Linux... Ok, booting the kernel."
If you don't pass 'kgdbwait' and connect to the target via serial or
ethernet, or use SysRq-G, you will see the following explicit message, on
all architectures:
	"Waiting for connection from remote GDB"

Now on the development machine start the gdb as shown below.
   % gdb ./vmlinux
   (gdb) set remotebaud 115200
   (gdb) target remote /dev/ttyS0

Example for kgdb ethernet interface
kgdboe=@10.0.0.6/,@10.0.0.3/ (that's kgdboe=@LOCAL-IP/,@REMOTE-IP/)
Then
   % gdb ./vmlinux
   (gdb) target remote udp:HOSTNAME:6443

Module Debugging:
-----------------
	For module debuggin with KGDB use gdbmod-2.4, which is base gdb(6.4) 
patched with feature for module debugging. It can be found at 
http://kgdb.linsyssoft.com/downloads/gdbmod-2.4.bz2 . Sources can be found at 
http://kgdb.linsyssoft.com/downloads/gdb-6.4-kgdb-2.4.tar.bz2
   % gdbmod-2.4 ./vmlinux

Debugging over ethernet:
------------------------
NAPI must be disabled in kernel's menuconfig for debugging over ethernet. 
NAPI is required for fast communication on 1G and 10G ethernet cards. 
It causes a card to start in ethernet driven mode and switch to polling mode 
on arrival of a packet. The polling mode is turned off as soon as incoming 
packets take a pause. KGDB can't live with such changes because it preempts 
normal processing. Even with 100M ethernet cards NAPI should be disabled.

or psdocs and so on, see 'make help' for a listing) for more information.
